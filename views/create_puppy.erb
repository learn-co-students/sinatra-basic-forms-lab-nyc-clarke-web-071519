<%# 4. Now, we need to create a form for a user to list a new puppy that is
   available for adoption. You can create this form in `views/create_puppy.erb`.
   Remember, you'll need to set up another controller action for a user to be
   able to view this form in the browser. The "submit" button
   of a form can be an `<input>` element with a `type` of `"submit"` (or a
   `<button>` element with a `type` of `"submit`) — a plain old `<button>`
   won't do it. If you want to change the text in the button, check out these docs: %>

<form method="post" action="/puppy">
  <label for="name"> Puppy Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

  <label for="breed"> Puppy Breed</label>
  <input type="text" id="breed" name="breed">

  <label for="months_old"> Puppy Age</label>
  <input type="text" id="age" name="age">

  <input type="submit" value="submit">
  
</form>
